## Overview
A perfect first challenge if you're new to HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal if you haven't learned about building responsive layouts yet.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I acquired the skill of centering a container both vertically and horizontally by utilizing flexbox.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

The website requires further enhancements in responsiveness, particularly for smaller screens.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Pseudo-classes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) - This helped me for targetting specific paragraphs in the container without adding a class to each paragraph element
